Introduction
------------

This Github project is a branch of https://github.com/Piker-Alpha/macosxbootloader/tree/master


Goals
-----

This project aims to add support for El Capitan (OS X 10.11) for unsupported Mac hardware with a 32-bit only EFI implementation. Like for example the first and second generation Mac Pro models. Though it should work well with any other model with a 32-bit EFI implementation.


Development
-----------

This project is maintained by Pike R. Alpha (https://pikeralpha.wordpress.com)


Current State
-------------

The current state of this project is: Phase 1 Completed (OS X 10.11 El Capitan is now supported). A second development phase began on Saturday 26 September 2015 and should soon be completed. A third development phase is also planned, to finish it up. See also our TODO list.
