Introduction
------------

This Github project is a new and updated branch of the [El-Capitan tree](https://github.com/Piker-Alpha/macosxbootloader/tree/El-Capitan) and is now targetted at macOS X 10.12 Sierra.


Goals
-----

This project aims to add support for Sierra (macOS 10.12) for unsupported Mac hardware with a 32-bit only EFI implementation. Like for example the first and second generation Mac Pro models. Though it should work well with any other model with a 32-bit EFI implementation.


Current State
-------------

Work in progress...


Download
--------

Prebuilt copies of the new boot.efi for macOS 10.12 Sierra are not yet available.


Compilation
-----------

Don't want a prebuilt copy of boot.efi then compile the source code yourself, with either Microsoft Visual Studio 2013 or 2015. The latter requires you to update the solution files, but that should be done automatically in the MS Visual Studio IDE.

Note: See also [Compiling-Instructions](https://github.com/Piker-Alpha/macosxbootloader/wiki/Compiling-Instructions)


Thanks To
---------

This project would not have been possible without the help of Peter Holbrook and Mike Boss. Peter did all compiling and Mike ran dozens of test builds that Peter pushed out over at forums.macrumors.com Awesome work guys. Job well done!


Donations
---------

I do not accept donation at this time.

Note: Sorry. I can't help you. I don't have unsupported hardware with 32-bit EFI.
